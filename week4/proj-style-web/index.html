                <p>The space plane is fill with mystical cools a dangerous cold dreids.
                 stars and star dust filled with the infinity that goes on forever.
                 it look so good that you could eat it.Space is a hard vacuum, meaning it is a void containing very little matter.
                 There is no sound in space because molecules are too far apart to transmit sound.
                 The space between galaxies is not completely empty but has an average of one atom per cubic meter.
                 There are an estimated 100-400 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way. </p>

                   <p> Spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure, but this wasn't the type of excitement she was hoping to experience.<br>
                   As she contemplated the situation she found herself in, she knew she'd gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for.<br>
                   It wasn't often that she found herself in a pool full of liquor.<br></p>

                   <p>There may be a planet made out of diamonds.As space facts go, this is pretty impressive.<br>
                     Research by Yale University scientists suggests that a rocky planet called 55 Cancri <br>
                     e — which has a radius twice Earth’s, and a mass eight times greater – may have a surface made up of graphite and diamond.<br>
                      It’s 40 light years away but visible to the naked eye in the constellation of Cancer.</p>

                   <p> Since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see, they must have been formed quite recently, that is, geologically speaking.<br>
                       What can explain these striations and their common orientation? Did you ever hear about the Great Ice Age or the Pleistocene Epoch?<br>
                       Less than one million years ago, in fact, some 12,000 years ago, an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over Burke Mountain in a southeastward direction.<br>
                       The many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode. The scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders.<br>
                        The ice sheet also plucked and rounded Burke Mountain into the shape it possesses today.</p>
