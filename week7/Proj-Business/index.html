              <p>Marius Streicher was born in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.<br>
               He was raised by his uncle who was a mechanic with the Bundespolizei (BPOL) Aviation Group.<br>
                As a result, Streicher was around engines and motors at an early age.<br>
                While he demonstrated skills in mechanics, it didn't hold the challenge that he was looking for.<br>
                Since he had an affinity for complex machinery, his uncle encouraged him to study aeronautical engineering at university,<br>
                 but the strict academic form was an uncomfortable fit for him. So while Streicher's grades were acceptable, he had a tendency toward restless antics.<br>
                Following his hobby and passion for flying, he spent considerable time around pilots and aircraft.</p>
